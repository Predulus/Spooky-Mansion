Lowpoly Stylized Spooky Mansion by 3DFurnace 
--------------------------------------------

Quickstart - Open the prefabs folder and drag either 'Spooky Mansion - Night.prefab'  or 'Spooky Mansion - Day.prefab' into your scene. 
Ensure post-processing with bloom is turned on for best results.  Also a suitable night or day skybox and suitable directional light.

Alternatively open Demo Scenes folder and open either 'SpookyMansionDemoScene_Night.unity' or 'SpookyMansionDemoScene_Day.unity'.  These
scenes also contain instances of the bonus Well, Path and Bush models.

Note:  the shadowy figure of a person in the window can be taken away by editing the prefab and removing the WindowFigure mesh
